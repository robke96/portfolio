            Hi, I’m Robertas, a {myAge}-year-old developer from Lithuania.
        <br /><br />
        I started coding in 2022 by building Discord bots, currently working with PLC, HMI systems, and production software.
        <br /><br />
        I’m also learning backend development with Go and TypeScript through real-world projects.
